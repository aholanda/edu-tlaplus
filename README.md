# TLA+ basic teaching material

TLA+ is a formal specification language developed by Leslie Lamport. It is used to design, model, document, and verify programs, especially concurrent systems and distributed systems. TLA+ has been described as exhaustively-testable pseudocode,[4] and its use likened to drawing blueprints for software systems;[5] TLA is an acronym for Temporal Logic of Actions.
